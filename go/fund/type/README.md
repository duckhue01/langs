### interface 
1. standard library
2. implementation
3. method set
4. polymorphism
5. type embedding (composition)
- go allow you to take existing types and both extend and change their behavior
6. wrapping up 
7. 
- User-defined types can be declared using the keyword struct or by specifying an existing type.

- Methods provide a way to add behavior to user-defined types.

- Think of types as having one of two natures, primitive or non-primitive.

- Interfaces are types that declare behavior and provide polymorphism.

- Type embedding provides the ability to extend types without the need for
inheritance.

- Identifiers are either exported or unexported from packages.**
