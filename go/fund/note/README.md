#### go programming language

1. go bridge these competing worlds and offers a high-performance language with feature that make development fast
2. go has really robust complier
   1. go simplified dependency resolution algorithms (ex: they don't allow circle import)
   2. let you take the advantage of interpreter language like js but also keep type safety
3. concurrency
   1. go routines
        go routines is user level thread that mean each thread can hold multiple go routine. the cost to create a go routine is cheaper than creating a thread (memory)

        it's easy to use

    2. channels


4. go's type system
   1. go use composition instead of inheritance reduce the headache but it's still keep the code reusable property
   2. go interfaces model small behaviors

5. memory management
